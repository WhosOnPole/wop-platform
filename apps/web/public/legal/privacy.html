<p><strong>If you are located in the EU or UK, this section applies to you.</strong></p>
<p>The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and UK GDPR require us to explain the valid legal bases we rely on in order to process your personal information. As such, we may rely on the following legal bases to process your personal information:</p>

  <li>If we have reasonable grounds to believe an individual has been, is, or may be victim of financial abuse</li>
  <li>If it is reasonable to expect collection and use with consent would compromise the availability or the accuracy of the information and the collection is reasonable for purposes related to investigating a breach of an agreement or a contravention of the laws of Canada or a province</li>
  <li>If disclosure is required to comply with a subpoena, warrant, court order, or rules of the court relating to the production of records</li>
  <li>If it was produced by an individual in the course of their employment, business, or profession and the collection is consistent with the purposes for which the information was produced</li>
